## Getting things started

I had this domain lying around for almost a year with just a blank page pointing to whatever my current mastodon profile was, but better late than never to get started and add some content.

For now, I'm creating this as a very - VERY - basic Jekyll website, using the default template with minor adjustments to it, and will write 100% in English for the time being.

Of course, the idea is to evolve into something which reflects more of my personality, and add translations at least to Portuguese (my native language), and German (my fourth language, which I'm still learning and will take some time to master). But these things will come with time or not at all, I'm not making promises here.
